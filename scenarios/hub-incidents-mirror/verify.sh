# hub-incidents-mirror: the daemon-to-Hub incident chain, over the shared pair.
#
# perf-sentinel 0.20.0 freezes the findings of the window that preceded an
# alert. PerfSentinelHub 0.1.6 mirrors those records into SQLite and serves
# them back. Nothing in either repository joins the two: the Hub's own tests
# drive a fake daemon, the daemon's tests never see a Hub.
# scenarios/incident-window-capture proves the daemon half against a local
# binary, scenarios/hub-ingestion proves the findings half over the cluster.
# The incident half of the chain, which is the copy an operator opens after
# the pod that produced it is gone, had no coverage anywhere.
#
# Legs, one numbered step each:
#
#   A. Pre-flight. Both keys, both deployments, both forwards, and a daemon
#      that reports the incident store enabled and a read key set.
#   B. The capture. A finding seeded for one service, then one Alertmanager
#      envelope posted with the WRITE key, then the daemon's own record read
#      back with the READ key: service, window bounds, frozen findings and the
#      namespace label the alert carried.
#   C. The mirror. The Hub reads the fleet on demand rather than waiting out
#      its poll interval, lists the incident keyed per source and WITHOUT its
#      findings, then serves them whole on the single-incident route,
#      signature for signature. This is the assertion the scenario exists for:
#      the Hub holds a copy of the daemon's record, not a re-derivation of it.
#   D. The filters. service, namespace, kind and source_id each narrow, a free
#      string with no match is an empty page, and a value naming configuration
#      the Hub knows is closed answers 400.
#   E. Failure isolation. A refused read key marks the source's
#      incidents_state unauthorized and says nothing about its findings.
#   F. Retention and the richest copy. The daemon's ring dies with its pod,
#      the Hub's copy does not, and a later poorer capture of the same id
#      never replaces it.
#
# Re-runnable. The incident id is content-derived, so a repost is the same
# incident, and every mutation this script makes to the shared pair is undone
# in the trap.
