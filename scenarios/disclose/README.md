# `disclose` scenario

Locks the **v0.8.2 headline feature**: periodic-disclosure two-tier avoidable
waste (schema `perf-sentinel-report/v1.1`). The `disclose` subcommand
aggregates, from archived per-window NDJSON, two avoidable-waste tiers:

- `aggregate.canonical_waste` — at the **binary-pinned** N+1 threshold `2`,
  which the operator **cannot** configure (anti-gaming). This is the headline,
  non-manipulable figure; the flat avoidable fields alias it.
- `aggregate.operational_waste` — at the operator's configured N+1 threshold.

## Run

```
make verify-disclose
# or pin a version:
PERF_SENTINEL_VERSION=0.8.2 make verify-disclose   # pin an older binary on purpose
```

Hermetic CLI scenario (no cluster/daemon): `docker run
ghcr.io/robintra/perf-sentinel:${PERF_SENTINEL_VERSION:-0.8.2} disclose` over the
committed fixtures.

## Sub-tests

1. **schema v1.1 + tiers** — `schema_version`, `canonical_waste.n_plus_one_threshold == 2`,
   `operational_waste.n_plus_one_threshold == 5`, both tiers `energy_kwh`/`carbon_kgco2eq` > 0.
2. **flat-field aliasing** — `estimated_optimization_potential_kgco2eq`,
   `aggregate_waste_ratio`, `aggregate_efficiency_score` alias `canonical_waste`.
3. **official intent + verify-hash round-trip** — `disclose --intent official`
   passes the validator (exit 0) and `verify-hash` recomputes the `content_hash`
   to OK on the untampered report (FAIL on a tampered copy). This closes the
   disclose→verify round-trip gap that `verify-hash-roundtrip` could not cover;
   it relies on the serde_json `float_roundtrip` fix shipped in v0.8.2.
4. **anti-gaming invariant** — over `reports-thr50` (same workload, operator
   threshold 50), `canonical_waste.n_plus_one_threshold` stays `2` (unchanged)
   while `operational_waste.n_plus_one_threshold` is `50` and
   `canonical_waste.waste_ratio > operational_waste.waste_ratio` — raising the
   operator threshold under-reports the operational tier but cannot touch the
   canonical headline.

## Fixtures

Real v0.8.2-daemon per-window archives harvested during the v0.8.2 release-gate
validation, with the `findings`/`correlations`/`warning_details` arrays trimmed
for size (the tiers live in `disclosure_waste` + `green_summary`, not
`findings`):

- `reports-thr5.ndjson` — operator threshold 5, canonical 2.
- `reports-thr50.ndjson` — same workload, operator threshold 50, canonical 2
  (n+1 reclassified to redundant at the high threshold).
- `org-config.toml` — complete org-config for `intent=official`;
  `specpower_table_version` tracks the pinned image's embedded CCF vintage
  (`2026-04-24` for 0.8.2). Bump it alongside `PERF_SENTINEL_VERSION` if the
  vintage changes.

## Which binary this runs against

`scripts/resolve-image.sh` picks the image: `PERF_SENTINEL_IMAGE` (a full
reference, for a locally built pre-release), then `PERF_SENTINEL_VERSION` (a
GHCR tag), then the pin in `manifests/perf-sentinel-daemon.yaml`.

It used to default to a hardcoded old tag, so the scenario ran green on every
release without ever touching the version under validation — the gate reported a
PASS for code it had not executed. The 0.9.25 round is what surfaced that, and
the eight image scenarios now share this resolution.
