# chart-disclose-persistence: prove that the upstream Helm chart's
# StatefulSet + persistence mode actually wires the public-disclosure
# archive to durable storage, that the archive survives a pod reschedule,
# and that the persisted file is a real `disclose` input.
#
# This closes a gap no other scenario covers:
#   - `disclose` / `disclose-temporal` are hermetic CLI checks against
#     committed NDJSON fixtures. They never touch the chart or a cluster.
#   - `chart-prometheusrule-pdb` is the only scenario that renders/installs
#     the real chart (charts/perf-sentinel/ in the perf-sentinel repo), but
#     it locks Phase A only (PrometheusRule + PodDisruptionBudget), not
#     persistence.
#   - `daemon-ack-workflow` proves PVC-backed persistence survives a
#     rollout, but against the lab's own hand-written manifest
#     (manifests/perf-sentinel-daemon.yaml), never through the chart's
#     StatefulSet template or its configmap.yaml auto-injection of
#     [daemon.ack] storage_path / [daemon.archive] path.
#
# So today the chart's render-time guards are unit-tested (the product
# repo's scripts/test/chart-render-guards-test.sh) and StatefulSet+
# persistence is schema-validated (helm-ci.yml template-matrix), but nobody
# installs it and proves the archive comes back after a restart. Chart
# 0.2.57 shipped exactly that class of bug once already (PVC mounted,
# nothing pointed at it, archive silently inert), so this is the live
# regression net for it.
#
# The daemon image is FROM scratch (no shell, no tar), so nothing execs into
# the perf-sentinel pod. File inspection goes through a throwaway busybox
# pod mounting the same PVC, which -- the PVC being ReadWriteOnce --
# requires scaling the StatefulSet to 0 first (same constraint
# daemon-sigterm-drain works around).
#
# Sequence:
#   1. helm install (workload.kind=StatefulSet, persistence.enabled=true)
#      --wait, from the chart source CHART_SOURCE resolves to, then assert
#      the running pod is on the image the chart's own appVersion selects.
#   2. Live-check the rendered ConfigMap actually carries [daemon.ack]
#      storage_path and [daemon.archive] path under the PVC mount.
#   3. Port-forward, inject a real N+1 fixture (shared with
#      daemon-sigterm-drain), wait for the trace to leave the window.
#   4. Scale to 0 and read the archive through a busybox reader: >= 1 window.
#      Scaling to 0 is load-bearing, not just PVC hygiene: the archive
#      writer buffers into a BufWriter and only flushes on rotation (100 MB)
#      or the graceful SIGTERM drain, so the scale-down is what puts the
#      line on disk.
#   5. Scale back to 1 (ordinal 0 reattaches the same PVC) and confirm
#      /health recovers.
#   6. Scale to 0 again and re-read: byte-identical to step 4.
#   7. Feed the post-restart archive to `disclose` and assert it aggregated
#      at least one real window (runtime+fallback window count >= 1) and
#      carried the injected N+1 through (anti_patterns_detected_count >= 1).
#
# Chart source, CHART_SOURCE:
#   auto  (default) local working-tree chart when its version is NEWER than the
#         newest published one (a release candidate: this is the pre-tag gate
#         the lab exists for), otherwise the newest published OCI chart.
#   oci   force the newest published chart from the OCI registry.
#   local force the working-tree chart at PERF_SENTINEL_CHART, else
#         ${PERF_SENTINEL_REPO_PATH:-$HOME/RustroverProjects/perf-sentinel}/charts/perf-sentinel.
# CHART_VERSION pins an explicit version and skips resolution.
#
# In `oci` mode the scenario needs no perf-sentinel checkout at all, which is
# what lets it run somewhere the product source is absent. Either way the
# resolved version is passed to helm as an explicit --version: the lab requires
# that on every helm install (docs/SCENARIOS.md, "Supply chain pinning").
#
# The daemon image is NOT overridden: the chart's own appVersion picks it, so
# the run exercises the chart/daemon pairing a real user gets.

# Parity with the documented consumer path (docs/HELM-DEPLOYMENT.md, "Software
# supply chain"): published charts are cosign-keyless-signed. Optional, like
# kubeconform/promtool in chart-prometheusrule-pdb. `helm install --verify` is
# deliberately not used, the chart ships no .prov file.
#
# Two portability details the documented one-liner does not carry:
#   - the identity regex uses [.] rather than \. because Git Bash rewrites
#     backslash escapes inside arguments, turning \. into /. and making the
#     match fail with a confusing "no matching CertificateIdentity";
#   - the signature is a Sigstore bundle attached as an OCI 1.1 referrer, not a
#     legacy sha256-<digest>.sig tag, so cosign 2.x reports "no signatures
#     found" and only 3.x verifies it. That is reported as a distinct verdict
#     rather than a flat failure, since the artifact is signed either way.
