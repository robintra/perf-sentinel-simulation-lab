# broker-messaging-waste: gate the messaging ingestion and the broker energy
# attribution added on top of 0.9.22 (product branch feature/async-support).
#
# The two coupled blocks it gates, messaging ingestion and broker energy
# attribution, are described in README.md.
#
# The product ships 2333 green unit tests, and the two-source arbitration is
# covered there against an INJECTED clock (take_broker_energy /
# patch_broker_energy take `now` as a parameter). That is precisely the limit:
# those tests never meet a scraper that delivers energy per interval and
# retroactively, that can answer WITHOUT the expected label, and that can die
# then come back. This scenario is the only place those three coexist. The
# arbitration was rewritten three times in review, each fix revealing the next,
# so legs A1-A6 map 1:1 onto the four rules the current code rests on.
#
# Legs (see README.md):
#   D    config: half-declared [green.broker_static], provider typo, cgroup
#        collisions (service_mappings and the database declaration), a broker
#        without an endpoint, and the two rejections that go through the
#        validator broker and database SHARE -- each naming THAT section.
#   A1   nominal, Alumet live and labelled: model is always alumet_rapl and
#        NEVER broker_specpower -- the declaration bills no measured window.
#   A2   energy sum over the window is the cgroup's own, not the declared
#        cluster's: double billing shows up as a near-doubling.
#   A3   Alumet cut: falls back to broker_specpower after staleness (3x the
#        scrape interval), with no window left without a figure.
#   A4   Alumet back: the first window after recovery does not stack measured +
#        declared. The retroactive delta reaches back over wall clock the
#        declaration already billed, and must be dropped exactly once.
#   A5   wrong label_value, healthy endpoint: broker_specpower continuously and
#        messaging_waste PRESENT. This is the review regression -- an endpoint
#        answering without the label measures nothing and must not suppress the
#        fallback.
#   A6   daemon booted with Alumet unreachable: the declaration bills from the
#        first windows. A never-scraped state must not read "fresh" during the
#        first staleness window.
#   A7   a late scrape banks a delta covering a hole the declaration already
#        billed, with NO scoring window running while that sample is fresh. The
#        path A4 cannot reach, and the one that needs the outage marker consulted
#        on the banked-delivery branch too.
#   B    disclosure v1.5: aggregate.messaging_waste with its three provenance
#        buckets and the invariant measured + declared + estimated ==
#        windows_with_figure. A broker_static-only period gives
#        measured_windows = 0; and re-hashing a real archived pre-v1.5 report
#        still yields its original content_hash (both new fields carry
#        skip_serializing_if, so the byte shape must be unchanged).
#   C    surfaces: `Broker waste` on /api/export/report, in `query monitor`'s
#        Energy tab and in the HTML dashboard, with no flicker across windows.
#   E    destination spellings the lab has no emitter for: RabbitMQ named and
#        default exchange, a Pulsar topic URL, an AMQP URI carrying credentials,
#        an IBM MQ / JMS queue, a routing-key glob.
#   E2   one RabbitMQ trace with three slow PRODUCER sends: exactly one
#        slow_messaging finding for probe-slow-rabbitmq, with three occurrences.
#   F3   the four crafted topologies, which localise any F1/F2 failure: receive
#        as sibling, as ancestor, a sibling that started BEFORE the receive (must
#        stay unlinked -- a false link is worse than none), and work under an
#        intermediate handler.
#   F1/2 the producer link on the REAL capture, per slice. Rate is over the
#        traces that are ANALYZABLE: half the linked consumer traces here are
#        CONSUMER-only and never enter the analysis at all.
#
# Self-contained: local release binary on loopback plus a python http.server
# serving the committed alumet-conformance capture of the REAL agent, augmented
# with one synthetic broker-cgroup series at a known joules-per-poll, so every
# figure is checkable arithmetic. No cluster, no Docker.
#
# The wall clock is compressed on purpose. What triggers the double billing is
# `scrape_interval > analysis batch cadence`, not the absolute 30s of the
# product report: the ratio is preserved (3s scrape vs a 1s trace TTL) and the
# durations shrink accordingly.
