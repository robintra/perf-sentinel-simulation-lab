# findings-page-filters

The 0.21.0 reading contract of `GET /api/findings`, and the fold behind it.

Self-contained: a local release binary, Docker, `python3` and `curl`. No
cluster, no Prometheus.

## Why it exists

0.21.0 changes four things about how a page of findings is read:

- `?grouping=` filters on the finding's effective grouping, the value the
  `grouping` Prometheus label has carried since 0.19.0, so one Grafana
  variable can drive both shipped dashboards.
- `?offset=` skips folded rows, so a fleet whose distinct signatures outgrow
  the 1000-row cap can be read a page at a time instead of only its newest
  thousand.
- An empty filter value now means no filter, where it was an exact match on
  the empty string. That is what lets a Grafana `All` option, which cannot
  send an empty `allValue` and sends a single space instead, reach an
  exact-match API.
- The fold materialises only the rows a page keeps, instead of cloning the
  first instance of every distinct signature and dropping most of them.

Nothing here covered any of it. The only query forms in the lab were
`service`, `type`, `severity`, `limit`, `since_ms`, `until_ms` and
`include_acked`, and no scenario had ever compared what the fold returns
against a published release. `grouping-identity` pins the grouping *value*
across ingestion boundaries and the JSON, HTML and CSV contracts, and never
reads the API's filters; `grouping-metrics-split` pins the same value on
`/metrics` and never reads the API at all; `query-monitor-api` asserts
`/api/config`, `/api/status` and `/api/energy`, never a findings page.

## What it asserts

| Leg | Claim |
|---|---|
| A | `?grouping=<value>` partitions the listing exactly, and the values it accepts are the ones `label_values(perf_sentinel_findings_total, grouping)` offers, with no conversion. |
| B | An empty, blank or `+` value is no filter, on all four string filters, and a padded value is trimmed. |
| C | `offset` walks the folded listing with no gap and no overlap, past the end is an empty `200`, and a page shortened by the ack screen is not the last page. |
| D | The rewritten fold returns exactly what the published release returns: same rows, same order, same representative, same counts. |
| E | A `serialized_calls` suggestion names at most three distinct templates, each cut at 120 characters, ends in ` -> ...` when more follows, and keeps the block's real count, total and parallel estimate. |

## Why three legs are A/B runs

Legs A, B, C and E each carry a counter-proof against
`ghcr.io/robintra/perf-sentinel:0.20.2`, and leg D *is* one.

That is not belt and braces. A leg that passes on both builds proves nothing
about the new one, and this lab has shipped that exact mistake: the 0.20.2
ledger entry records a release whose only change no scenario here could see,
which was found by reading the scenarios rather than by running them. The
counter-proofs make the failure mode loud instead. Concretely:

- 0.20.2 ignores an unknown query parameter, so `?grouping=` and `?offset=`
  return the whole listing there. With a single tenant, leg A would read the
  same number on both builds and pass on either; the corpus carries two
  namespaces for that reason alone.
- `?severity=` returns nothing on 0.20.2 and everything on 0.21.0. Leg B
  records that as the behaviour change it is, so a client relying on the old
  exact match is not left to discover it in an issue.
- On the same 40-call fixture the suggestion weighs 153 KB on 0.20.2 and 653
  bytes here. Leg E fails if the baseline sentence is not at least ten times
  the new one, which is what tells "the bound works" from "this fixture never
  produced a long sentence".

Leg D excludes `stored_at_ms` and `first_seen_ms`, which date the reception
and differ between two daemons fed the same corpus at different instants.
Everything the fold itself decides is compared, the representative's
`trace_id` and `severity` included.

The corpus is `tracegen` at a fixed seed **and a fixed `--run-nonce`**: the
nonce is what the service names derive from, and tracegen picks a fresh one
per process, so two runs of the same seed otherwise differ on every `service`
field and leg D compares nothing but that.

## Running it

```bash
make verify-findings-page-filters
```

Needs a local release build of the product:

```bash
cd ~/RustroverProjects/perf-sentinel && cargo build --release --workspace
```

and `opentelemetry-proto`, which tracegen's `http-pb` protocol imports:

```bash
pip install -r tools/tracegen/requirements.txt
```

Unlike the other local-binary scenarios, this one **fails rather than skips**
when Docker or the baseline image is missing: three of its five legs are
comparisons, and a scenario that quietly skips them reads exactly like one
that passed.

It also fails, rather than skipping, when the binary under test ignores
`?grouping=`. A release branch keeps the previous version in `Cargo.toml`
until tag time, so `--version` cannot answer whether a build has the
parameter, and the probe asks the daemon instead. From 0.21.0 on, a build
that ignores it is not an old binary, it is a moved contract.

Knobs:

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `BASELINE_IMAGE` | `ghcr.io/robintra/perf-sentinel:0.20.2` | the A side of every comparison, bump it with the pin in `manifests/perf-sentinel-daemon.yaml` |
| `FPF_DAEMON_HTTP_PORT` / `FPF_DAEMON_GRPC_PORT` | `14828` / `14827` | loopback ports of the daemon under test |
| `FPF_BASELINE_HTTP_PORT` | `14838` | published port of the baseline container |
| `FPF_SEED_A` / `FPF_SEED_B` | `4321` / `9876` | tracegen seeds, one per tenant |
| `FPF_NONCE` | `ab` | tracegen run nonce, shared by both sides so the service names match |
| `FPF_SERIALIZED_CALLS` | `40` | calls in leg E's sequential block |
| `FPF_SERIALIZED_TEMPLATE_BYTES` | `4096` | statement size in that block |

Report: `/tmp/scenario-findings-page-filters-report.md`.

Runtime is about a minute: two daemons, four 6-to-8 second tracegen runs and
two batch `analyze` calls.

## Files

- `verify.sh` — the five legs.
- `serialized_fixture.py` — leg E's corpus. tracegen has no `serialized`
  pattern and its templates are short, so neither knob reaches the sentence
  the leg measures: one root span and N SQL children, each starting after the
  previous one ends, each statement padded past the 120-character cut.
- `fold_compare.py` — reads a page dump: row counts, signatures, row keys,
  grouping values, one finding's suggestion, and the leg D comparison.
