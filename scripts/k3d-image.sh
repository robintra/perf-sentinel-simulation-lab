# Confirms that <image> is loaded into containerd on every k3d
# worker node (server + agent roles, loadbalancer excluded) of
# <cluster>. Prints diagnostic context to stdout when the check
# fails (either the names of nodes still missing the image, or a
# message identifying that no nodes were enumerable at all) and
# returns 1. Returns 0 only when at least one node was inspected
# and all of them have the image.
#
# Image matching uses fixed-string substring grep, which is robust
# to containerd's prefix variations (e.g. docker.io/library/...)
# and avoids regex injection on caller-supplied image names.

# layer cache is left intact. Best-effort: never fails the caller.
