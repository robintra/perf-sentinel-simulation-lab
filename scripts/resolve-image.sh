#
# Why this exists: eight image-based scenarios each carried their own hardcoded
# default (0.5.17, 0.5.21, 0.7.2, 0.8.13). A scenario pinned to an old tag runs
# green on every release without ever touching the version under validation, so
# the gate reported a PASS for code it had not executed. The 0.9.25 round found
# `esrs-e1-crosswalk` still asserting schema v1.3 and `intent-validator` still
# carrying a 2024 SPECpower vintage, neither of which any gate run could have
# surfaced.
#
# Resolution order:
#   1. PERF_SENTINEL_IMAGE: a full image reference, used verbatim. This is the
#      pre-release path: a locally built tag, or a digest.
#   2. PERF_SENTINEL_VERSION: a GHCR tag. Kept because every existing runbook
#      and CI workflow passes it.
#   3. manifests/perf-sentinel-daemon.yaml: the image the lab's daemon manifest
#      pins, so a scenario tracks whatever version the lab is validating. Used
#      verbatim: it may be a digest pin or a local pre-release tag left by
#      scripts/seed-daemon-local.sh, and neither can be rebuilt from a version
#      string.
#
# A scenario that genuinely needs a fixed version (a compatibility leg against
# an older binary, say) should name that version inline at its call site rather
# than defaulting the whole run to it.
