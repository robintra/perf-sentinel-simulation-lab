# Build a PerfSentinelHub image from a local source checkout, import it into the
# k3d cluster, and pin the hub manifest to it (working-tree edit, NOT committed).
#
# Mirrors scripts/seed-daemon-local.sh. One difference on purpose: no lab-owned
# Dockerfile under tools/. The daemon needed one because the product's release
# Dockerfile expects a pre-built build/ directory its .dockerignore does not
# ship; the Hub's own Dockerfile is already a source-to-binary multistage build,
# so building it directly also exercises the real release recipe.
#
# Unlike the daemon there is no published fallback image: the committed manifest
# carries a placeholder tag and the pod stays in ImagePullBackOff until this
# script runs.
